# A small CRM system
#### this code I wrote with the help of YouTube playlist

If you want to see how it works you should do the following:

Save both "env" and "hometask" folders on your PC
In command line interpriter go to the folder env/scripts and activate the virtual environment
Then you go to the folder "hometask" and run `python manage.py runserver`
Copy http://127.0.0.1:8000 and paste in your browser
